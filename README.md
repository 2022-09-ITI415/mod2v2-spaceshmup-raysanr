# 05-Space-SHMUP
 Adjusted: 
 Blaster firing delay from .2 to .1, velocity from 50 to 70 and damage on hit from 1 to 2
 Spread damage from 1 to 3, delay between shots from .4 to .2 and velocity to from 50 to 75
 Shield base was increased to 4 in order to make gameplay easier with the added random enemies spawn point
 Ship speed was increased from 30 to 40 with a projectile speed increase from 40 to 70.
 Adjusted Enemy 1-5 power up rates by 0-.10 from a base value of .25-.75.

All the listed changes are direct buffs to both the firing, damage and movement ability of the ship but
was done in order to balance gameplay between new features. First feature was to add new enemy ships. I added
two enemy ships, one that is a semi-boss with increased hp, score and guarenteed power up drop, and a second 
plays as a "Spike" mechanic to almost always kill ship due to rapid speed and HP. This is to get player to 
continue to move around the map as to lessen their chances of getting spiked. The second feature added was
a new weapon unlocked through Phasers or Missile that plays similar to the main weapon but with a higher damage and a 
duel channel stream of firing rates. This feature is also a great way for player to continue and take out bosses as 
they appear and ultimately take out the Spike bosses that appear and group up over time.
